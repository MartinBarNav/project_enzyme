    <string name="substrate_help">You can set the environment of the cells under your microscope using the settings on this page. Most settings are supposed to be self-explanatory but a few requires explanations and they are given below. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Radiation&lt;/b>: Radiation will damage your cells and introduce random mutations. A small amount of radiation can help your cells evolve into a stronger species, a very high amount will quickly ruin the genome and might kill your cells. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Only point mutations&lt;/b>: Checking this will limit the mutations to small changes to your genomes. The cell types or modes of children will for example not be changed whereas the continuous parameters like split mass can be changed. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Dynamic friction&lt;/b>: This is the friction coefficient cells experience while moving. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Static friction&lt;/b>: This is the friction coefficient cells experience while still. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Viscosity&lt;/b>: This sets the amount of Stokes drag experienced by moving cells. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Salinity&lt;/b>: A low salinity will make your cells spend a lot of energy keeping their salt-balance. A higher value will let them survive longer without any energy source. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Density&lt;/b>: A low substrate density will make your cell sink when gravity is turned on, a high substrate density will make your cells float when gravity is turned on. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Density gradient&lt;/b>: A density gradient will make the density higher at the substrate bottom and lower at the top. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Nutrient coating&lt;/b>: This gives nutrients a lipid coating that has to be removed before they can be eaten. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>&lt;font color=#BFF79D>Nitrates&lt;/b>: This sets how fast cells absorb nitrates from the environment. All cells consume nitrates when they split and secrocytes consume it continuously. Nitrocytes are necessary if this is set too low.</string>

    <string name="tip_child_1_angle">"With this slider you can choose what way daughter cell 1 is facing after this cell splits. The arrow on each cell indicates what angle it is facing.

An angle of 0° means that daughter 1 will be facing towards daughter 2. Increasing the angle rotates it counter-clockwise unless the splitting cell is mirrored, in this case the angle is defined clockwise."</string>
    <string name="tip_child_1_mdoe">"Use this setting to choose what mode daughter 1 will be in when cells of this mode split.

Any cell can be in one of 40 different modes. Each mode has different properties that you can set. Two of the properties are what modes the daughter cells will be in when the cell splits.

If your first cell is in mode 1 and it splits to two cells in mode 1, then all you cells will always be in mode 1. If on the other hand it splits into two cells in mode 2 and they further split into two cells each in mode 1, then you will end up with just cells in mode 1 and 2. It is in these cases just necessary to specify the properties of mode 1 or 1 and 2 respectively since these are the only modes your cells will be in.

The properties of the other modes are though carried on generation after generation of your cells even if they are not expressed so if some useful feature of an organism is coded there, it might surface anyways if your environment contains radiation so that your cells mutate once in a while. This happens in nature as well, many parts of e.g. the human genome do not describe any proteins used in the body."</string>
    <string name="tip_child_2_angle">"With this slider you can choose what way daughter cell 2 is facing after this cell splits.

When a cell is copied from the microscope to the genome editor (top choice in \"Load\"-button menu) the mode the cell was in will be taken as the initial."</string>
    <string name="tip_keep_adhesin_c1">"If this cell is connected with adhesin to another cell when it split then daughter 1 will retain this adhesin connection if this box is ticked.

Note that daughter 2 must end up on the side where the adhesin connection is for this to work."</string>
    <string name="tip_mirror_c1">"Checking this check box makes daughter 1 of cells in this mode mirrored with respect to its parent. This means that if a cell is mirrored its daughter 1 would not get mirrored and vice versa.

All angles are measured counter-clockwise by default but if a cell is mirrored all angles (split angle, child 1 angle, child 2 angle) are defined clockwise instead.

This property can be useful to make mirror-symmetric organisms without having to use many different cell modes with fine-tuned splitting angles."</string>

    <string name="tip_priority">"Cells connected with adhesin can transport nutrients between them. The flow of nutrients between two connected cells is proportional to the weighted difference between their masses. The weights are the priorities of the opposite cells.

This means that nutrients flow from more massive cells to less massive ones and from cells with low priority to cells of high priority. An equilibrium will be reached where cells of higher priority have larger masses.

If both cells have high priorities the equilibrium will be the same as if they both have low priorities, but it will be reached faster."</string>

    <string name="tip_secrocyte">"This specifies what substance to secrete.

Food/Coated Food smell/Light sense activator/Wall sense activator will affect nearby Senseocytes and Stereocytes just like the corresponding real stimuli would. They work by emitting substances that more strongly attach to the corresponding receptors and can thus give stronger signals than the natural stimuli.

Cyanide will kill unprotected organisms upon touch.

Lipase breaks down lipids on food particles so they can be eaten by phagocytes. This also hurts all but the Keratinocytes slightly since it breaks down the cell membrane.

Protease breaks adhesin connections if it touches two connected cells simultaneously.

Signal substances will diffuse to cells on touch. The - signs indicate a signal substance inhibitor."</string>
    <string name="tip_snap">Checking this makes all angles snap to multiples of 15° and all other values to one of 25 discrete levels.</string>
    <string name="tip_split_angle">"With this slider you can set at what angle this cell splits at. The dashed lines in the preview show where the cells will split.

Each cell is facing a specific direction (indicated by arrow), the initial cell is always facing to the right both in the preview window and when placed under the microscope. A split angle of 0° means that the cell splits perpendicular to the direction it is facing, daughter 1 will end up in this cells rear and daughter 2 will end up in the front.

Increasing the split angle will rotate the line of splitting counter-clockwise, unless this is a mirrored cell, in that case the split angle is defined clockwise."</string>
    <string name="tip_split_mass">"The mass of each cell is proportional to the amount of chemical energy they have. Cells grow when they get more energy than they consume and shrink otherwise.

When a cell's mass is larger than the split mass of the mode it is in it will split into two daughter cells.

A cell can not split until it is 30 min old so if this mass is reached before then it will not split until both requirements are met simultaneously."</string>
    <string name="tip_split_ratio">The split ratio dictates how the mass of cells in this mode is distributed among the two daughter cells when it splits.</string>
    <string name="tip_stay_alive">"When a cell is in a mode with this box checked it will receive an increase in nutrient priority when it is running dangerously low in nutrients.

This can be used to make sure that cells in an organism that have low nutrient priority will not give away their very last nutrients and die.

If cells in a certain mode are not essential and perhaps superfluous in an event of starvation it might be useful to untick this box."</string>
