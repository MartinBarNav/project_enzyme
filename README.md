# Project Enzyme
Project Enzyme is a Cell Lab mod focused around expanding the game's genome editor. It seeks to aid creativity by adding features that allow for larger and more complex organisms to be created with the limitations of the genome editor.

Here is a list of the biggest features:
80 Cell Modes
New genome editor parameters such as:
The ability to adjust the maximum size of cells
The ability to set a minimum amount of connections before cell split
The ability to set a limit on how many times a mode can split.
The ability to change a cell's mode after the split limit is reached
New cell type: The osteocyte (WIP)
Backwards compatibility with vanilla genomes for easy migration (just make sure to back them up when you install the mod)
Working saving/loading system with modified .substrate and .genome savefiles to include modded features.
Support for newer devices (Up to 2023)
'Sandbox' mode. All challenges are unlocked automatically, giving access to all of the game's features. (Mostly intended to facilitate mod development)
More signals. Up to 16 signals for Neurocytes and other signal cells.
New signal equation: The sine wave. With modifiable frequency and amplitude parameters.

Those are the main features of the mod. But alot more is going on in the background and i may have even forgotten some features since development has been paused since March.

Project Enzyme is not just intended to be a mod for the playerbase. I fully intend it to be the base for future community mods. You may decompile and add features on-top of my mod. I think that would be beneficial to the community since it seems this is still the most advanced mod to date.
